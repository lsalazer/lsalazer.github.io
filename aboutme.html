<p> Given the oppurtunity to actually write for the first time since I started I will use this website to write about myself. </p> <p>I am currently enrolled in the post-graduate GIS program at Fleming College. I did that to learn the skills needed in the workplace. 
I learned all of the theory based information in my time studying human geography at Brock University and am was looking to get the hands 
on experience in the program at Fleming. So, here I am creating this wonderful website in HTML for my lovely Web Design and Programming course that 
never frustrates me. </p> <p>

For the past month you can usually catch me spending 10 hours a day staring at my laptop screen going "how is that not working, what am I supposed to do".
Normally most of my day would be centered around running, no matter the weather (see image below). I would workout twice a day, focus on eating at certain times, get lots of sleep. I also used to spend my day 
listening to music or reading and now I am just a gremlin who rarely sees the light of day.
